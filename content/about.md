# Harisankar P S

**Technical Lead** | Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Cloud Infrastructure

I build fast, reliable web applications and the infrastructure to run them. With 15+ years of professional experience shipping software, I specialize in Ruby on Rails architecture, PostgreSQL performance optimization, and cloud deployments on AWS.

Currently working as a **Technical Lead**, previously ran my own software consultancy. I also build and maintain [open source tools](https://github.com/coderhs).

## What I Do

- **Backend Architecture** -- Ruby on Rails (through Rails 8.1), API design, background processing with Sidekiq
- **Database Engineering** -- PostgreSQL (read/write replication, high availability deployments, GIN indexes, query optimization), schema design
- **Cloud & DevOps** -- AWS (ECS/Fargate, RDS, EC2, S3), Docker, Terraform, Nginx, Linux server administration
- **Full-Stack Development** -- Next.js, React, Vue.js, Go
- **Infrastructure** -- Tailscale networking, self-hosted deployments, CI/CD pipelines

## Conference Speaking

I've spoken at international conferences on topics like database-driven application performance and building resilient systems. Recordings of my talks are on the [Videos](/videos/) page.

I also give trainings and workshops on Ruby on Rails for students and working professionals, and speak on open source, diversity in tech, and entrepreneurship.

## Work Experience

I have been building web software since 2006 -- starting with PHP (Joomla, Drupal, PHP-Fusion), moving into Ruby on Rails and modern full-stack development. Beyond Ruby, I have production experience in Go, Python, Crystal, Elixir, Java, and TypeScript.

Currently a **Technical Lead**, where I lead the development of a major application -- driving architecture decisions, enforcing best practices, and ensuring code quality across the stack. Prior to this, I ran my own software development consultancy -- working as a freelance architect, consultant, and product builder for clients across industries.
