# About Harisankar P S (HsPS)

I am a free spirited, free thinking, technology and open source enthusiast. I have been building web based software(s), some way or the other, for the past 14 years (since 2006). Started with customizing PHP scripts like PHP-Fusion, Joomla, Drupal, etc for personal projects, to the present professional development using Ruby on Rails and React.JS/Vue.Js. In between those years, I have also dabbled **[1]** in many technologies such as Python, Java, Erlang, Lua, Elixir, Crystal Lang, Go, Typescript, to name a few.

I love working with servers, orchestrating them to run in unison like a musical symphony.

Simple but Jada **[2]**

## As a speaker

I love sharing what I learn, even the simple stuff. As a self learner (and slow learner) myself, I have gained tremendous knowledge and life changing inspiration from those who take the effort to explain the small & complicated stuff in much detail. I try to do the same by speaking, coaching, and helping beginners.

## Work Experience

Professionally I have always been an entrepreneur working as a freelance programmer, consultant, building products, and managing my own software development company.
