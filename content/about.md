# About Harisankar P S (HsPS)

I am a free spirited, free thinking, technology and open source software enthusiast. I have been working with web based softwares some way or the other for the past 14 years (since 2006). Started with building and customizing PHP scripts like PHP-Fusion, Joomla, Drupal, etc for personal projects to the present programming work with Ruby on Rails and React.JS/Vue.Js based applications. In between those years, I have also dabbled **[1]** in many technologies such Python, Java, Erlang, Lua, Elixir, Crystal Lang, Go, etc. I love working with servers, orchestrating them to run in unison like a musical symphony. 

For some people driving fast cars is whats makes them high, for me its making web app run faster.

My creed in work, life, and business:

Simple but Jada **[2]**

## Public Speaking

I love sharing what I learn, even the simple thing. As a self learner (and slow learner) myself, I have gained tremendous knowledge and gain inspiration from those who take the effort to explain the small stuff in much detail. I try to do the same by speaking, coaching, and helping beginners.

## Work Experience

Professionally I have always been an entrepreneur working as a freelance programmer, consultant, building products (for market), managing my own team of programmers in a small Rails Boutique Company.



{{% admonition note "Notes" true %}}
* **[1]** For me to say I dabbled, I should write minimum of 1000+ lines of code in the language (or someone must have paid me to write a script/program/solution for them in the said language)
* **[2]** Jada is a term in my primary language malayalam meaning Amazing
