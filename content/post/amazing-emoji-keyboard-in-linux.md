I am a developer who moved from Windows, to Linux, to macOS, to Linux. A typical developers joruney üòÜ. So moving from
windows to Linux was over 13-14 years ago. I didn't much from the windows world other tham games and single executable
files. But moving from macOS to Linux, has been a bit tough. KDE has been able to provide me with everything I want and
more. The one thing that I missed the most was the emoji keyboard, with easy to launch shortcut.

My usage of emoji was at its peak during macOS days, I used emoji for my communications, commits, function name and
even terminal aliases. üòà Not everyone was fan of my emoji usages, but i loved it.

After moving back to linux, I missed it quite a bit and always have been on the lookout for a good substitute.
Today, I finally found it.

Now, KDE(Kubuntu) has an emoji selector/keyboard, but the flow is not the same as in macOS.

The workflow macOS has was:
1. you press ctrl+shift+space
2. the emoji keyboard open
3. you select the emoji you want
4. Its pasted on the cursor location - be it terminal/document/anywhere that accepts text

## Installation

I recommend installing it as a debian package and then customizing it.


```sh
sudo apt-get install xdotool rofi xsel
wget https://github.com/cspeterson/splatmoji/releases/download/v1.2.0/splatmoji_1.2.0_all.deb
sudo dpkg -l splatmoji_1.2.0_all.deb
```

Test it:

```sh
splatmoji copy
```

Now once tested, we need to do some customization. Followed by setting up keyboard shortcut to launch it for easy access.

## Customization

create the following file: .config/splatmoji/splatmoji.config

```sh
# history_file=~/.local/state/splatmoji/history
history_length=5
paste_command=xdotool key ctrl+shift+v
rofi_command=rofi -dmenu -p '' -i -monitor -2
xdotool_command=xdotool sleep 0.2 type --delay 100
xsel_command=xsel -b -i
```

I need this because ctrl+shift+v is paste for me and not the default ctrl+v

## Setting up KDE Shortcut

1. `System Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts`

2. `Edit > New > Global Shortcut > Command/URL`
3. Give it a name Emoji (or anything you like)
4. Trigger (Trigger tab): set the short cut you want, I used `ctrl+alt+space`.

5. Action  (Action tab): `splatmoji copypaste`

## More Emoji

Even though there are a lot of emoji in the repo, my usage requires more üòÅ.
To feed ones greed, they can create the following folder

```sh
/home/coderhs/.local/share/splatmoji/data
```
then place emoji's inside a tsv file as follows. `<Emoji source name>/<any_name>.tsv`

A simple collection to add:

```sh
mkdir rofi-emoji
cd rofi-emoki
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mange/rofi-emoji/master/all_emojis.txt > emoji.tsv
```

## Final words

The only concern right now is I have too much steps, to make it the way I want. So I need to write a script to
automate all the above steps. I need to find how to setup the keyboard shortcuts using command line, and I will
publish the script.
