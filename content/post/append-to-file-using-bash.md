```sh
echo "Line you want to append" >> ~/ideas.md
```

The command here that ammends the line to the file is `>>`. If you place any string block before this operator and point it to a file, it will get appended.

```sh
tail -f something.log | grep important >> ./important.log
```

Note: if you use the operator `>` instead or accidentally, it will overwrite the whole file it is point to.
