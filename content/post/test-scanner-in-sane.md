2024 [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) has begun, and I decided to dive into some open-source contributions! One project that caught my eye was the [Scanner Server](https://github.com/CoolCat467/Scanner-Server). It offers a web interface for using scanners, which seemed pretty interesting.

I was eager to contribute but quickly realized I didn‚Äôt have a scanner to test it with üòÖ. Fortunately, Linux‚Äôs SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) software comes to the rescue! It includes a feature that lets you select a test scanner model. With this, you always have a virtual scanner called ‚Äútest‚Äù available. While it only scans a black image, it behaves just like a real scanner for all practical purposes.

<!--more-->

Here‚Äôs how to enable the test scanner:

* Open the SANE configuration file:

```sh
sudo vim /etc/sane.d/dll.conf
```

* Search for the word `test` in Vim:

```vim
/test
```

This will take you to a line that looks like `#test`. Simply remove the `#` in front of `test` to enable it.

And that‚Äôs it! No need to restart any services‚Äîyour virtual scanner is ready to go.
