htop/top is a useful command that helps users understand how much of there CPU (Different core)/RAM are being used. We would like to see the same for GPU there are tools that provide that, but sadly unlike cpu top/htop the ones for GPU are sadly fragmented. Based on your GPU vendor we have different tools to provide us this graphical info.

Note: I am talking about tools i tested in Ubuntu/Debian Linux

For nvidia

* nvtop
* gpustat


For intel (iRIS)

* intel_gpu_top (from intel-gpu-tools package)

For AMD GPUs

* radeontop
