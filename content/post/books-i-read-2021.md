As a followup on my 2020 article on the list of books I have read in 2020. Here is 2021 version. I aimed to read at least one book a month in 2021. During some months I was able to achieve more than one book a month, but sadly I couldn't keep it up for the whole year. 2022 is another year, hope to be able to do one book a month minimum this year.

<!--more-->

I read a total of 8 books this year. Which was the same number of books I read last year. So hi5 to me for consistency.
