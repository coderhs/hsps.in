**Which Language Should Build This Software In?** or **Which language should I have this software developed In?**

This is a question that software devs gets asked a lot by there friends/colleague who are not part of the software industry. This is my answer to them:

If you had an idea of a novel? or a poem? which language will you write it in. Italian, Tamil, Bengali? Would you try to learn a new language because there are a lot of similar novels (anime) in Chinese or Japanese.

The best language to write your novel is the language you know the most.

So when you are researching on building an idea, what you need to concentrate on is finding a person you are most comfortable working with. You should be inviting tech savoy people for a cup of coffee or couple of beers, asking them how they would build this app (if they have to). Learning the information they are offering and slowly building the blueprint. Finding smarter and smarter people learning from them. Because that's how everyone learns.

My thoughts and recommendations for a non-tech person trying to start a tech company/product

1. You might not have to or want to code, but you shouldn't look like an idiot. So learn the industry.
2. Meet more and more tech savoy and smart people, more information will enter your brain through osmosis even if you don't understand everything.
3. Build blueprint - try to build small quantifiable steps
4. Be ready to make mistakes - Hey making mistakes and moving forward is still better than dreaming about success
5. Hire freelancers - try to build those small steps, learn what they did or build.
6. Stop trying to build rome in a day
7. Be a cheerleader a smart cheerleader and not a drunk one who don't remember the score
